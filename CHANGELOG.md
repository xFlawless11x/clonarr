# Changelog

## v1.5.0-beta

### Features
- **Debug logging** — Enable in Settings to write detailed operations to `/config/debug.log`. Logs sync, compare, auto-sync, and UI actions. Download button for easy sharing when reporting issues.
- **Compare: sync history awareness** — Compare uses Clonarr sync history to accurately identify which score-0 CFs were deliberately synced vs unused defaults. Works best with profiles synced via Clonarr.
- **Auto-sync per-profile toggle** — Enable/disable auto-sync individually for each profile directly from Sync Rules & History. Global toggle removed from Settings.
- **Auto-sync error visibility** — Failed auto-sync rules show error badge with tooltip in Sync Rules

### Improvements
- **Settings: auto-sync clarification** — Description explains that auto-sync triggers on TRaSH pull changes, not on a fixed schedule
- **Settings: active rules moved** — Auto-sync rules managed under Profiles → TRaSH Sync instead of Settings
- **Compare: info note** — Visible warning about score-0 limitations for profiles not synced via Clonarr

### Bug fixes
- **Compare: score-0 CFs** — CFs synced with score 0 via Clonarr now correctly shown as "in use"
- **Sync: case-insensitive BuildArrProfile** — Score assignment no longer fails for mixed-case CF names

## v1.4.0-beta

### Features
- **Profiles tab reorganized** — Three sub-tabs: TRaSH Sync, Profile Builder, and Compare
- **Compare Profiles redesigned** — Uses TRaSH CF groups with per-group status badges, only flags actual errors (wrong scores on active CFs, missing required CFs)
- **Compare: auto-sync from Compare** — Sync fixes and enable auto-sync directly from comparison results
- **Auto-select instance** — When only one instance per type exists, automatically selected across all functions
- **Auto-sync rule auto-update** — Existing auto-sync rules automatically updated with new selections when you re-sync

### Improvements
- **Compare: smart verification** — Optional CFs with score 0 are not flagged as errors, exclusive groups (Golden Rule, SDR) verified correctly
- **Compare: "Extra in Arr"** — CFs not in the TRaSH profile shown with removal option
- **Sync Rules & History** — Visible in TRaSH Sync tab with auto-sync badges and re-sync/remove buttons
- **Profile Builder** — Moved to dedicated tab with description and prominent Create/Import buttons
- **Consistent status display** — All instance selectors show Connected/Failed/Not tested uniformly
- **Descriptions** — Added tab descriptions for TRaSH Sync, Profile Builder, and Compare

### Bug fixes
- **Compare: HTML rendering** — TRaSH descriptions now render HTML correctly (was showing raw tags)
- **Compare: category colors** — Group cards show colored left borders matching TRaSH categories
- **Maintenance cleaned up** — Only Cleanup and Backup/Restore remain (Compare moved to Profiles)

## v1.3.0-beta

### Features
- **TRaSH JSON export sort order** — Matches TRaSH convention (grouped CFs by score, Tiers, Repack, Unwanted, Resolution)
- **Case-insensitive CF matching** — Handles name mismatches like HULU/Hulu across sync, compare, and single-CF operations
- **Builder: formatItems group display** — CFs in formatItems shown in their TRaSH group with Fmt state (e.g. Audio in SQP-3 Audio)
- **Variant dropdowns with templates** — Golden Rule and Misc variants auto-detected and visible when loading templates

### Bug fixes
- **syncSingleCF updates CF specs** — Not just score, also corrects name and specifications
- **pdHasOverrides tautology** — Copy-paste error causing override banner to always show
- **SelectedCFs deep copy** — Fixed concurrency bug in config store
- **Resync restore** — Correctly sets deselected CFs to false (not just selected to true)
- **Resync loads sync history** — Synced Profiles section now appears immediately in Maintenance

## v1.2.0-beta

### Features
- **Sync view refactored to TRaSH groups** — Replaced custom category grouping with TRaSH CF groups (matches Notifiarr's approach)
- **Group toggles** — Include/exclude groups from sync, required CFs shown with lock icon
- **"All" toggle** — Bulk toggle for optional groups with 3+ CFs
- **Group descriptions** — TRaSH descriptions visible when expanded, bold amber warnings
- **Cutoff override dropdown** — Select from allowed quality items, TRaSH default, or "Don't sync cutoff"
- **Profile Builder: "Add more CFs"** — Search field with live filtering and "Clear All" button
- **Instance connection status** — Quality Size, File Naming, Maintenance tabs show actual connection status
- **Tab persistence** — Last selected tab saved to localStorage
- **Resync from Maintenance** — Opens profile detail with previously synced optional CFs restored from sync history

### Bug fixes
- **Sync engine fix** — Group toggles now actually affect dry-run/sync (required CFs from disabled groups properly excluded)
- **Custom cutoff values** — Now correctly sent to backend (was broken before)
- **CI hardening** — GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs, removed redundant lowercase step

## v1.1.0-beta

### Features

- **Golden Rule fix** — Only selected variant enabled (HD or UHD), not both
- **TRaSH JSON export** — Strict format matching TRaSH sync expectations
- **Group includes export** — Optional checkbox shows `quality_profiles.include` snippets
