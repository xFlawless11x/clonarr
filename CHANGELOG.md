# Changelog

## v1.8.8

### Fixed

- **Custom CF storage — eliminate cross-app name collisions** — Imported custom formats with identical names in Radarr and Sonarr (e.g. `!LQ`) no longer get a `(2)` suffix. CFs are now stored in app-scoped directories (`/config/custom/json/{radarr,sonarr}/cf/`). Existing installations migrate automatically on startup — old files are moved to the correct subdirectory and collision suffixes are stripped.
- **CF editor Type dropdown empty on first open** — The "Type" dropdown in the Custom Format editor showed "Select type..." instead of the actual type (e.g. Source, Release Group) when opening a CF for the first time. Root cause: `<template x-for>` inside `<select>` is invalid HTML and the browser silently removes it. Replaced with programmatic option creation via `x-effect`.
- **Export TRaSH JSON broken over HTTP** — The "Export TRaSH JSON" button in the CF editor silently failed on non-HTTPS connections (e.g. LAN access). Replaced with a proper export modal showing formatted JSON with a Copy button, matching the profile builder export style.

## v1.8.7

### Fixed

- **Custom Format editor — context dropdown showed wrong app types** — When editing a user-created CF, the "Trash Scores → Context" dropdown listed all contexts regardless of app type. A Sonarr CF's dropdown showed Radarr-only SQP tiers (`sqp-1-1080p`, `sqp-2`, etc.) and `anime-radarr`. The list is now derived dynamically from the actual TRaSH-Guides CF JSONs on disk via a new `/api/trash/{app}/score-contexts` endpoint, so Sonarr CFs only show Sonarr contexts (including `anime-sonarr`) and Radarr CFs only show Radarr contexts (with all SQP tiers). New contexts added by TRaSH upstream are picked up automatically without code changes.

### Improved

- **Sync Profile modal — clearer dropdown labels and descriptions** — All three dropdowns (Add / Scores / Reset) had labels and descriptions that either implied the wrong behavior or hid important details. Rewritten against the actual `BuildSyncPlan` / `ExecuteSyncPlan` logic so each option states exactly what it does:
  - **Scores:** "Enforce TRaSH scores" / "Allow custom scores" suggested TRaSH defaults override everything and that "custom scores" meant Clonarr-side overrides. Both misleading — Clonarr score overrides apply in *both* modes, and the real distinction is how Clonarr handles manual edits made directly in Arr's UI. Renamed to "Overwrite all scores in Arr" / "Preserve manual edits in Arr" with descriptions that spell out the behavior precisely.
  - **Add:** "Automatically add new formats" didn't mention that this mode respects manual CF removals in Arr (the actual reason to pick it over "add missing"). Renamed to "Respect manual removals — only add new ones" and the description now explains the `lastSyncedSet` comparison and the first-sync edge case.
  - **Reset:** "Reset unsynced scores to 0" didn't clarify that only non-zero scores are touched, or what "unsynced" means. Renamed to "Zero out orphaned scores" and the description spells out that it targets CFs in the target Arr profile that are no longer part of this sync.
  No logic change — pure text and label rewrite.
- **File Naming tab — verbatim TRaSH-Guides text** — All descriptions on the File Naming tab now quote TRaSH-Guides directly instead of paraphrasing. Clonarr is a TRaSH sync tool; it should use the wording the guide maintainers have crafted. Replaced the "Why use a naming scheme?" and "IMDb vs TVDb / TMDb" info cards, per-scheme descriptions (Original Title, P2P/Scene), section descriptions for Movie File/Folder Format, Episode/Series/Season Folder Format, and the Plex "Edition Tags" warning with their TRaSH-Guides source text. Source file paths documented in the UI markup.

## v1.8.6

### Added

- **Quality Group editor in TRaSH sync overrides** — Edit quality groups directly from the Customize Overrides dialog without opening Profile Builder. Drag-and-drop to reorder, drop on a row to merge, click a group name to rename. Create / rename / merge / ungroup / delete / reorder groups inline.
- **Multi-arch GHCR builds** — `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` (Apple Silicon support).

### Fixed

- **Memory leak** — Every API call created a new `http.Client` with its own connection pool, accumulating ~2-3 MiB/hour of unreclaimable transport state. Replaced with two shared clients (one for Arr/Prowlarr API, one for notifications). Also fixed event slice reslicing to release old backing arrays.
- **Five sync diff blindspots** — Sync previously missed Radarr-side changes that kept the same set of allowed qualities: reorder items, reorder groups, extracting a quality from a group, cutoff change, and upgradeUntil change. The diff was set-based and silently ignored ordering and structure. Replaced with a structure-aware fingerprint that captures ordering, group structure, and allowed-state. Covers Auto-Sync, manual Sync, and Sync All.
- **Sync result banner hiding change details** — After Save & Sync, the profile detail banner only showed `cfsCreated` / `cfsUpdated` / `scoresUpdated` counts. Quality flips, cutoff changes, and per-CF changes were in the backend response but never rendered. Banner now lists the full details.
- **Imported profile toast hiding change details** — Same blindspot in the `startApply` toast path. Now renders the full details list like `Sync` / `Sync All` already did.
- **Quality structure override loss on auto-sync** — Enabled structure overrides now survive every sync regardless of upstream TRaSH quality/CF/score changes.
- **Cutoff handling with structure override** — Cutoff dropdown reads from the override structure when set (so renamed/created groups appear). "Reset to TRaSH" properly clears the structure override.

## v1.8.5

### Fixed

- **Zombie process leak** — `git auto-gc` was detaching as an orphan subprocess and getting reparented to the Go binary running as PID 1, which the Go runtime does not reap. Accumulated ~79 zombies in 6 hours under normal load. Fix: `tini` as PID 1 in the Dockerfile (`ENTRYPOINT ["/sbin/tini", "--", "/entrypoint.sh"]`), plus `git config gc.auto=0` on the TRaSH data dir in `ui/trash.go` (both the fresh-clone and migration code paths). Verified zero zombies after 3+ hours in production.

## v1.8.4

### Fixed

- **CF tooltip showing raw markdown** — Descriptions with Wikipedia links (e.g. streaming service CFs) now display as clean text instead of raw markdown syntax

## v1.8.3

### Fixed

- **Browser autofill popup on Settings** — URL and token fields no longer trigger browser password save/fill dialogs

## v1.8.2

### Improved

- **Sync Rules column headers** — TRaSH Profile, Arr Profile, Auto-Sync, Details, and Actions columns with consistent alignment across all rows
- **Arr Profile ID** — Profile ID shown next to Arr profile name (e.g. `ID 23`) for easy identification
- **Builder Synced Profiles** — Same column layout as TRaSH sync (Your Profile, Arr Profile, Details, Actions)
- **Text readability** — All secondary text lightened from `#484f58` to `#6e7681` across all tabs (quality sizes, scoring sandbox, settings, compare, builder)
- **Healthcheck suggestion UI** — Suggestion box hidden when no Extra Parameters command is available (e.g. distroless images)

### Fixed

- **conflicts.json parser** — Updated to match the TRaSH Guides PR #2681 schema where trash_ids are object keys, not fields. Ready for when the PR merges.

## v1.8.1

First stable release — all previous beta versions consolidated.

### Features
- **Gotify push notifications** — Configurable Gotify support for all notification types (auto-sync, cleanup, repo updates, changelog). Per-level priority toggles (Critical/Warning/Info) with customizable priority values.
- **Second Discord webhook** — Separate webhook for TRaSH Guides updates (repo changes, weekly changelog), keeping sync notifications on the main webhook.
- **Settings reorganized** — Collapsible accordion sections: Instances, Notifications, Auto-Sync, Advanced. Cleaner layout as settings grew.

### Bug fixes
- **Gotify fires independently of Discord** — Notifications no longer require a Discord webhook to be set. Gotify and Discord send independently.
- **Priority value 0 preserved** — Gotify priority value of 0 (silent) now persists correctly through restarts instead of being reset to defaults.

## v1.8.0-beta

### Features
- **Auto-sync GUI toasts** — When scheduled or manual pull triggers auto-sync, toast notifications show detailed results (CF names, score changes, quality items) with staggered 3s delay between multiple profiles.
- **Detailed sync toasts** — quickSync, Sync All, and toggle auto-sync now show specific changes (e.g. "Repack/Proper: 5 → 6") instead of just counts.
- **Sync All respects auto-sync** — Only syncs profiles with auto-sync enabled. Shows warning if no profiles qualify.
- **Scheduled pull diff toast** — Scheduled pulls show "TRaSH updated: ..." toast in GUI automatically.
- **Instance version display** — Settings shows "Connected · vX.Y.Z" for Radarr, Sonarr, and Prowlarr consistently.
- **Prowlarr auto-test** — Prowlarr tested on init and every 60s alongside Radarr/Sonarr.

### UI improvements
- **Sync rules layout** — Fixed min-widths for profile names, arrow, Arr name, and auto-sync toggle for vertical alignment across all rules.
- **Larger arrow** — Profile → Arr arrow more visible (15px, lighter color, centered margins).
- **Settings layout** — Instance URL inline after name, version on same line as Connected.

## v1.7.9-beta

### Features
- **Compare overhaul** — Compare tab now shows profile settings (min score, cutoff, language, upgrade allowed, quality items) alongside CF comparison. All sections in collapsible cards with summary badges and status icons.
- **Settings sync from Compare** — Checkboxes on each setting/quality diff: checked syncs to TRaSH value, unchecked keeps current value as override. Overrides passed to sync modal automatically.
- **Override and custom CF badges on sync rules** — TRaSH Sync tab shows separate pills: blue "X custom CFs" for user-created formats, amber "X overrides" for score/quality/settings overrides. Tooltips explain each.
- **Auto-sync immediate run** — Enabling auto-sync toggle now runs sync immediately instead of waiting for next TRaSH pull.
- **Pull toast notification** — Manual pull shows toast with result: "TRaSH data up to date" or diff summary.
- **conflicts.json support** — Auto-deselect conflicting CFs when TRaSH merges conflicts.json. Activates automatically on pull.

### Bug fixes
- **Optional exclusive groups (SDR)** — Can now deselect all toggles. Golden Rule still requires at least one active.
- **Sync All Fixes** — Confirm dialog with profile names. Correct profile pre-selection via resyncTargetArrProfileId.
- **Required CFs counts** — Compare badges now show section-specific counts (not global totals that included grouped CFs).
- **Auto-sync hidden in Compare sync** — Sync modal from Compare hides auto-sync toggle.
- **Select option type mismatch** — Fixed String vs number comparison for Arr profile dropdown pre-selection.
- **Shallow clone diff detection** — Pull diff works reliably with shallow clones (fetch uses `--deepen=1`).

### Internal
- Prepared conflicts.json parsing (ConflictsData structs, API endpoint, frontend loading). Zero-downtime activation when TRaSH merges PR #2681.

## v1.7.7-beta

### Bug fixes
- **Profile Builder buttons missing** — `_resyncReturnSubTab` and `_resyncNavigating` were not declared in Alpine data, causing console errors and hiding Create/Save/Sync buttons entirely.
- **Top action bar in Profile Builder** — Save/Sync buttons now shown at top of builder (not just in sticky bottom bar), matching user expectation.
- **Auto-sync hidden for builder profiles** — Sync modal no longer shows auto-sync toggle for builder profiles (manual sync only, prevents TRaSH/builder conflicts).

## v1.7.6-beta

### Features
- **Git diff Discord notifications** — "TRaSH Guides Updated" now shows actual file changes (Added/Updated/Removed per CF, profile, group) via git diff instead of stale updates.txt entries.
- **Separate weekly changelog notification** — "TRaSH Weekly Changelog" Discord notification sent only when TRaSH updates their changelog (amber embed, distinct from per-pull blue notifications).
- **Latest Update in GUI dropdown** — Changelog dropdown now shows last pull's actual changes at the top, with timestamp and commit range. TRaSH Changelog (updates.txt) shown below.
- **Next pull countdown** — Header bar shows time until next scheduled pull (auto-updates every 30s).
- **Arr profile name in Discord** — Auto-sync Discord notifications show Arr profile name when different from TRaSH profile name.
- **CF tab uses TRaSH groups** — Custom Formats tab now uses actual TRaSH CF group files as categories instead of hardcoded fake categorization. Each group file is its own collapsible section with color-coded borders.
- **Multi-column CF lists** — CF lists with 10+ items use 2 columns, 30+ use 3 columns for compact display.

### Bug fixes
- **CF description duplicate name** — TRaSH markdown descriptions started with a bold title line repeating the CF name. Now stripped automatically.
- **Pull remote URL sync** — Changing repo URL in settings now updates the git remote before fetching. Previously the old remote was used until re-clone.
- **Quality override flip-flop** — Quality overrides (user-toggled resolutions) are now applied before comparing with Arr state, preventing false Enabled/Disabled changes on every sync.
- **Discord "no changes" spam** — Auto-sync no longer sends Discord notifications for profiles that are already in sync.
- **Discord bullet point formatting** — Fixed indented bullet points rendering incorrectly in Discord embeds.
- **Manual pull sends Discord notification** — Manual pull button now triggers "TRaSH Guides Updated" notification (previously only scheduled pulls did).
- **timeAgo auto-updates** — Sync timestamps in UI now update automatically every 30s without manual refresh.
- **Sync history auto-reload** — Frontend detects when scheduled pull completes and reloads sync data automatically.
- **Last diff persisted to disk** — Latest Update diff survives container restarts.
- **Unique category colors** — Fixed duplicate colors for Streaming Services, Optional, Resolution, and HQ Release Groups categories.
- **Improved text contrast** — Fixed dark-on-dark text for commit hash, changelog counts, and PR links in UI.
- **Dockerfile version** — Updated from 1.7.2-beta to 1.7.6-beta.

## v1.7.5-beta

### Bug fixes
- **Builder/TRaSH sync rule separation** — Auto-sync disabled for builder profiles (manual sync only). Prevents builder rules from overwriting TRaSH sync history on pull.
- **Auto-sync rule updated on source change** — Syncing a TRaSH profile to an Arr profile with a builder rule now converts the rule permanently. No merge-back possible.
- **Confirm dialog on source change** — Warning shown when syncing overwrites a rule of different type (Builder→TRaSH or TRaSH→Builder).
- **Startup cleanup safety** — Cleanup skips instances returning 0 profiles (race condition when Arr is still starting).
- **Reset Non-Synced Scores** — Now includes extra CFs, custom CFs, and all CFs from sync history. Previously only checked standard TRaSH profile CFs, causing user-synced CFs to be falsely flagged.

## v1.7.4-beta

### Features
- **Instance health check every 60s** — Connection status now updates automatically within a minute when instances go up or down (was 5 minutes).
- **Comprehensive debug logging** — Cleanup, auto-sync, TRaSH pull, and sync errors now all logged to debug.log for easier troubleshooting.
- **Profile Builder description** — Clarified as "For advanced users" with amber warning, pointing users to TRaSH Sync tab.

### Bug fixes
- **Sync errors shown as "no changes"** — Backend returns `{"error":"..."}` but frontend only checked `result.errors` (array). Connection failures now correctly show red error toast.
- **Error badge persists through toggle** — Toggling auto-sync no longer clears the error badge. Error clears only when a sync succeeds.
- **Sync All/quickSync sets error badge** — Manual sync failures now set lastSyncError on auto-sync rules, not just auto-sync failures.
- **Sync All toast type** — All failures = red, some = amber, none = blue (was always amber or blue).

## v1.7.3-beta

### Features
- **Builder sync rules in Builder tab** — Builder synced profiles now shown in Profile Builder tab instead of TRaSH Sync, with distinct tooltips and "Sync All" per tab.
- **Discord notifications for settings changes** — Auto-sync notifications now show profile settings changes (Min Score, Cutoff Score, etc.) and zeroed scores with CF names.

### Bug fixes
- **Create-mode cutoff override preserved** — Cutoff override no longer replaced by first allowed quality when user's chosen cutoff is still valid.
- **Update-mode settings-only changes detected** — HasChanges() now always executes for updates, catching min score and cutoff changes that were previously skipped.
- **Cutoff read-only display shows override** — After Done, cutoff override now shown in amber instead of always showing TRaSH default.

## v1.7.2-beta

### Features
- **Add Extra CFs** — Add any TRaSH CF to a profile via Customize overrides. CFs organized in real TRaSH groups with collapsible headers, toggles, and search. Default scores from profile's score set.
- **Quality overrides redesign** — Dynamic columns, toggle switches, amber override indicator.
- **UI polish** — Column layout for Profile section, toggle switches for override panel, number input spinners removed globally.

### Bug fixes
- **quickSync fallback for importedProfileId** — Pre-v1.7.1 sync history entries now check auto-sync rule as fallback, preventing builder profiles from zeroing on upgrade.
- **Extra CFs persisted** — Restored on resync, included in auto-sync rules and quickSync.
- **Extra CF browser wrong type** — Reset on profile switch to prevent showing radarr CFs for sonarr.
- **Resync loads grouped browser** — extraCFGroups populated after resync (was empty).
- **Reset to TRaSH clears Extra CFs** — Toggle, search, and selections all cleared.
- **CF name casing auto-corrected** — CFs with wrong casing (e.g. HULU vs Hulu) are now updated to match TRaSH's canonical name on sync.
- **Orphaned scores case-insensitive** — Maintenance Reset Non-Synced Scores no longer flags CFs with different casing as out of sync.
- **Tooltip links clickable** — SQP description tooltips now have styled, clickable links. Tooltip stays visible when hovering over it.
- **CF info icon more readable** — Info icon and trash ID in builder now use lighter color for better visibility.

## v1.7.1-beta

### Features
- **Per-CF score overrides on ALL CFs** — Score overrides now work on required CFs and core formatItems, not just optional. Enables overriding scores on CFs like Anime Dual Audio while keeping everything else synced with TRaSH.
- **Create New button** — Duplicate a synced profile as a new Arr profile with different settings. Available on both TRaSH and builder profiles.
- **Builder badge in Sync Rules** — Blue "Builder" tag identifies profiles from Profile Builder.
- **Info banner for builder edits** — Warning when editing builder profiles from Sync Rules that changes affect the profile itself.
- **Sync behavior in create mode** — Add/Scores dropdowns with dynamic descriptions.
- **Edit/Sync/Sync All** — Sync Rules buttons for quick actions with toast result summaries.
- **Custom CF amber grouping** — Custom CFs in dedicated amber-styled category.
- **Toast notifications** — Centered, progress bar, multiline for Sync All breakdown.
- **Profile group sorting** — Standard → Anime → French → German → SQP.

### Bug fixes
- **Builder profile resync zeroed scores** — Resync/quickSync from TRaSH Sync tab fell back to TRaSH base profile instead of imported profile. Now correctly sends importedProfileId.
- **Edit from Sync Rules opened wrong view** — Builder profiles now open in builder editor with correct values.
- **Dry-run/apply reset to TRaSH profile** — After dry-run on imported profiles, code opened TRaSH base profile detail, losing all builder settings.
- **Instance data survives delete+recreate** — Orphan migration now checks instance type to prevent cross-type contamination.
- **Multi-instance support** — Builder sync functions find correct instance from sync history instead of assuming first.
- **API key field appeared empty** — Edit mode shows "Leave empty to keep current key".
- **Stale _resyncReturnSubTab** — Cleared on manual tab switch to prevent stale navigation state.
- **History matching for imported profiles** — Also checks importedProfileId for profiles without trashProfileId.
- **Prowlarr test connection** — Fixed "authentication failed (HTTP 401)" when testing Prowlarr after page refresh.

### Refactoring
- **Generic FileStore[T]** — profileStore 239→14 lines, customCFStore 248→76 lines.
- **Handler helpers** — decodeJSON/requireInstance reduce boilerplate across 10+ handlers.
- **22 unit tests** — sync behavior, field conversion, score resolution, FileStore.

## v1.7.0-beta

- **Custom CF amber grouping** — Custom CFs displayed in a dedicated amber-styled "Custom" category in CF browser.
- **Sync behavior in create mode** — Add and Scores dropdowns now visible when creating new profiles. Dynamic descriptions explain each option.
- **Profile group sorting** — Standard → Anime → French → German → SQP. New TRaSH groups appear before SQP.
- **Toast notifications** — Centered top, progress bar, auto-dismiss. Used for sync results, cleanup events, and errors.
- **Auto-sync rule on every sync** — Syncing a profile always creates an auto-sync rule (disabled by default). Toggle on/off directly from Sync Rules.
- **Multiple profiles from same TRaSH source** — Same TRaSH profile synced to multiple Arr profiles with different overrides and CF selections.
- **Discord cleanup notifications** — Amber embed when synced profiles are auto-removed because the Arr profile was deleted.
- **Friendly connection errors** — User-friendly messages instead of raw TCP errors in Discord and Settings.
- **Instance data survives delete+recreate** — Sync history and rules preserved when instance is removed and re-added.

### Refactoring
- **Generic FileStore[T]** — Replaced duplicated CRUD in profileStore (239→14 lines) and customCFStore (248→76 lines).
- **Handler helpers** — `decodeJSON` and `requireInstance` reduce boilerplate across 10+ handlers.
- **22 unit tests** — Coverage for sync behavior, field conversion, score resolution, and FileStore operations.

### Bug fixes
- **Cutoff error on resync** — Cutoff resolved against stale quality items. Now resolved after rebuild.
- **Min Score / overrides not syncing** — Overrides not applied in create mode, not saved in auto-sync rules, not sent when only profile settings changed.
- **Resync didn't restore settings** — Optional CFs, overrides, behavior, target profile, and score overrides now fully restored.
- **SnapshotAppData missing Naming deep-copy** — Shared pointer could cause data corruption on concurrent access.
- **Custom CF field format** — TRaSH `{"value":X}` now converted to Arr array format on write, preventing HTTP 400 errors.
- **Deleted auto-sync rule still running** — Race condition fix with fresh config re-check before execution.

- **Stale sync history after profile deletion** — Auto-cleaned on pull, page load, with Discord notification.
- **Create mode contaminated existing profile** — syncForm.arrProfileId now reset when switching to create mode.
- **Keep List search, File Naming feedback, confirm modals** — Various UI fixes from user reports.
- **Connection errors spammed Discord** — Friendly message, only on startup or new TRaSH changes.
- **API key field appeared empty on edit** — Now shows "Leave empty to keep current key".

- **Startup auto-repair** — On container start, resets auto-sync commit hashes (ensures all rules re-evaluate) and removes broken rules with arrProfileId=0

### Bug fixes
- **Quality items not applied** — Quality item rebuild was running before the `updated` flag, so changes were never sent to Arr
